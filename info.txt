------

Prisma's findUnique and findFirst methods are used to retrieve a single record from the database, 
but they have some differences in their behavior:

- findUnique: This method is used when you want to retrieve a single record that matches a unique constraint or a primary key. 
If no record is found, it returns null.

- findFirst: This method is used when you want to retrieve a single record that matches a non-unique constraint. 
It can also be used with ordering and filtering. If no record is found, it returns null.

In summary, use findUnique when you're sure the field you're querying by is unique, 
and use findFirst when you're querying by a non-unique field or need more complex queries with ordering and filtering.
